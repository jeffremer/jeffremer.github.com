Hello, my name is <a href="http://jeffremer.com" title="Jeff Remer">Jeff Remer</a> and I am software engineer at <a href="http://flite.com" title="Flite, Inc.">Flite, Inc</a>.

Outside of the office I enjoy working on my own code.

Ruby (Sinatra, Rails), Javascript (browser, mobile, node.js), and Objective C (iOS, desktop Cocoa) are a few of my favorite languages.
		
Here is a small sample of some recent projects.

* [Distiller](https://github.com/jeffremer/Distiller)

> A javascript aware content proxy.  This node.js based, (somewhat) RESTful API downloads the 	
> content from a URL and runs given portion of javascript on the contents - assign your 
> results to a special variable to output the transformation.

> [Distill.me](http://distill.me) is running on [Duostack](http://duostack.com).
	 
* [Regression Steps](https://github.com/jeffremer/Regression-Steps)

> A Ruby class, Sinatra web app, and command line tool for retrieving and formatting a tab-delimited regression test
> checklist from Scrumy user stories suitable for pasting into a spreadsheet.

> A live example of the Sinatra web app is [running here](http://rstep.heroku.com) on [Heroku](http://heroku.com).
