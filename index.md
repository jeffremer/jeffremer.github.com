Hello, my name is <a href="http://jeffremer.com" title="Jeff Remer">Jeff Remer</a> and I am software engineer at <a href="http://flite.com" title="Flite, Inc.">Flite, Inc</a>.

Outside of the office I enjoy working on my own code.

Ruby (Sinatra, Rails), Javascript (browser, mobile, node.js), and Objective C (iOS, desktop Cocoa) are a few of my favorite languages.
		
Here is a small sample of some recent projects.

* [Scrumy Client](jeffremer.com/scrumy-client)

> A Ruby REST client wrapper for the Scrumy REST API.  This is mostly an experiment in
> metaprogramming.  The REST resources are specified in a DSL and the library imports
> and dynamically create and instantiate classes and objects of the right type depending
> on the requested resource.


* [Distiller](https://github.com/jeffremer/Distiller)

> A javascript aware content proxy.  This node.js based, (somewhat) RESTful API downloads the 	
> content from a URL and runs given portion of javascript on the contents - assign your 
> results to a special variable to output the transformation.

> [Distill.me](http://distill.me) is running on [Duostack](http://duostack.com).
