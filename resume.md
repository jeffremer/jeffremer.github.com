# Background

I am a software engineer and web developer with expertise in a array of web technologies.
While most of my professional experience is with Java and related J2EE packages, I
enjoy staying up to date on emerging tools and languages. Some of favorite languages are
ruby (CLI, Rails, Sinatra), JavaScript (Node.js, browser), and Objective-C (iOS, Desktop Cocoa).
Most projects I create outside of work use one of those languages and I enjoy creating new
projects to learn new technologies. I have made some minor open source software contributions
and maintain a couple of my own small open source projects.

See my [bio](http://jeffremer.com/bio.html) for more background and an explanation of specific
projects.
