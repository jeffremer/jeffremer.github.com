# Node.js

### Ryan Dahl (Node.js) (Saturday, 2:30pm)

Ryan talked about the history and roadmap for Node.js going into the next stable release (v0.6). Including:

* Windows support (who cares?)
* Replacing the internal DNS resolver with a system level DNS resolver
* Distribution/Scaling (allusions to future project)

Originally he planned to talk about a new Node.js feature/tool.  It's not done, so he didn't.  Entertaining talk, but nothing new.
