# Projects, Community, and Github

### Andy Lester (@petdance) (ack) (Sunday, 10:15am)

## Who is Github for?

GitHub is for developers.  Not for end-users.  Click a link to a GitHub project and an end-user would be horribly confused and instantly lost.

Users don't care about or want to see code. To a newcomer the source tree is unimportant.

They want to know:

* What's it do?
* What's it look like? (Screenshots!)
* Do I want to use it?

## Make a Project Site

* Answer the newcomer's questions
* Aimed toward end-users
* Users who are as ninja as you
* Make downloads incredibly obvious

Order these things by importance to new user.

### Get you own domain

Not tied to source control (you might move, gasp!)

#### Visible documented releases!

* Let others build on your work
* Release for history and visibility
* Changelogs (Human Written!)

The needs of the many outweight the needs of the few.

Most people are not from California and work at a startup writing software.                     

# Barrier to Entry

...has reduced over the years (SourceForge>Google Code>GitHub).  Anyone can make changes and submit them easily.

This is good news, and bad news.  Newbies expect their changes are going to be accepted.  Changes might not be in the best interest of the project.

# Leading a Project

In rejecting changes:

* Be gentle
* Brevity will be construed as harsh

Don't just cut people off - if at all possible accept changes from newcomers.  Newcomers will energize your project.

## Make a Project Guide

* Specific Tasks (small chunks of the elephant) - generalizations are not helpful
* Project direction - roadmap
* Code standards - helps people started without having to guess (welcoming)
* Workflow + branch strategy - describe the process
