# Success, and Farming vs. Mining

### Wil Shipley (Sunday, 4:00pm)

Talking about his [blog post](http://blog.wilshipley.com/2011/04/success-and-farming-vs-mining.html).  It's a metaphor for running a software company.  Miners strike it rich quick, farmers have to put in a ton of work before you see a product or money.

A VC will give you money to run a company.  You'll make a good living.  But they want their money back, they want you to sell.

You'll be concentrating on eventually going public, or selling, instead of making a good product and selling it a decent price.

You'll be interested in touching spaces, releasing minimum viable products without good design.

> _"They want to pee on it and make it theirs"_

Everyone is doing the exact opposite of what is actually really successful.  You're busy thinking about investing, not making a good product.

Mining is no good for a software company.
