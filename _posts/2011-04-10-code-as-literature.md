# Code as Literature

### Jeremy Ashkenas (coffeescript) (Sunday, 2:15pm)

Reflecting on coding in general. High level languages like Ruby, Python, Javascript are minor miracles. We used them because they are fluent: like literature, or the way we think.

## Is it bigger than a breadbox?

What is the impact of your code and the codebase?  To effectively talk about code you need deep hierarchies.  This is unprecedented in any other technology.

# Code as Logic

Code is just bits.  However we can thing of things of strings, complex models, etc...

### Knuth's Definition

1. Finite - must complete
2. Definiteness - discrete steps
3. Input
4. Output - if you didn't output anything did your code really run?
5. Effectiveness - must accomplish something

## Briding the Semantic Cap

1. Code
2. Abstract Syntax Tree
3. Bytecode
4. Machine Instructions
5. Electricity & Gates

Code is drastically abstracted - looking at just code, you wouldn't know what was going on.  Looking at a map and looking at a city you can see that lines are streets and boundaries.  Code is far too removed from what actually goes on.

# Code as Law

In the real world we understand how laws describe actions.  On a machine, code is the only law.  Software constrains how a person can interact with the machine.

# Code as Art

Code, music, art are all designs of the mind that are intellectual property.  "Computer programming is more properly described as an Art than a Science" - Knuth.

## Concrete Arts vs. Abstract Arts

Concrete arts: music, painting, play - they exist in space and time.  Code, architecture, composition - nothing changes in reproducing it.  They need to be manifested to experience them.  Code needs to be run.

Code is like writing, but code has a dual audience: machine to understand and the reader to run and understand.

# Structured vs. Literate Program

Sequencing, Selection, Repetition (Dijksrta) vs. Clarity through Literate Programming (Knuth).

Literate programming seeks to explain to the user what we want to the machine to do.  You write an essay, code fills in the detail.

# Code as Literature

A book or essay is a program in the mind of a reader.  You need to balance expressiveness and abstraction with control over the details.

## Literary Abstractions in Code

### Metaphor

Subclassing is metaphor.

### Synecdoche

A piece is part of the whole thing.

### Metonymy

An attribute of a thing is the whole thing.

### Personification

A things _knows_ how to do something.
