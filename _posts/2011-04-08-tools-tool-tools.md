# Tinker Bell being a Great Tools Fairy

### Dr. Nic Williams (Saturday, 10:30am)

# Tools, & Tool Tools

Once you start making lots of tools, you need tools to make tools.

1. Learn Something
2. Make Tool
3. Tool Tools

Once you start doing steps 1 and 2, you'll need step 3.

# Textmate (Editor, Snippets, Commands)

## 1. Learn Something

You learn something, but unless you keep using it you forget.  Or the API changes.  Or something else comes out and it distracts you.

## 2. Make Tools

Keep using what you learn by making tools that keep you using it.  Textmate bundles for example.

## 3. Tool Tools

Soon you have so many tools you don't know what to do with them.  So you need something to manage them, help distribute them.  Nic created [choctop](http://drnic.github.com/choctop/).

You don't want to write applescript to create a DMG to distribute your Textmate bundles.  He wrote choctop to create DMGs.

# Autocompletion

## 1. Learn

`complete -F <completefn> CMD`
	
DIY tab completion

## 2. Wrap in a tool

You can add autocompletion anywhere for any tool by wrapping that in a tool.

## 3. tabtab

[TABTAB](https://github.com/drnic/tabtab) lets you specify the autocompletions for any gem in ruby.

# Takeaway

You can write documentation, that's great.  But if you can write tools to encapsulate what you learn that's better.
