# Hacking Space Exploration

### Ariel Waldman (Saturday, 2:00pm)

The relation we have with space is one of observation. Only about 500 people have ever been in space. NASA is public, yet very closed.

Unless you worked for a government agency you simple don't have access to the expensive resources.  However, science hasn't always been this way.  Many prominent scientists of the past was done by people who would today be considered amateurs or hobbyists.

# How would having access to Space affect us?

Just being able to have access to space exploration would create a scientific revolution.

You don't need to be an astronaut, or work at NASA to explore space.  Space should be accessible to everyone.

# Open Collaboration

There are groups collaborating to send things into space (schools, competitions, etc..).

In 7 years we went from crashing a robot into the moon to landing humans on the moon.  If amateurs are now sending robots out, that means it's a very exciting time for amateur space exploration.

# @Home

* SETI@Home - no human involvement, people lost interest
* Stardust@Home - people helped scientific project
* [Galaxy Zoo](http://galaxyzoo.org) - collaborative galaxy classification project

Galaxy Zoo is a social, collaborative tool that is about more than just being a data monkey.  Humans collaborate to solve problems, which in turn 

# Small Spacecraft/Satalites

### Cubesat

Slowly becoming more financially accessible (still $8-10k for parts, and 50-100x that for a launch).

### Spacedroid/Spaceduino

For about $150 you get a weather balloon payload system.  Affordable, therefore accessible.  Not quite space, as it only goes about 30km, whereas space is considered 100km.

Still, for $150 we can do what NASA did in the 50/60's.
